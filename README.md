# Things i'm proud of:
The website shows different button depending on who is logged in, and who isn't. For example if the owner of the spot open the spot's page, then the edit, delete, and add image button appear, but the same doesn't happen if the current user doesn't own the spot.

This also extends to the ability to leave a review only if you're a user and haven't left a review yet, and the owner also being unable to leave a review.

I'm also fairly proud of the media queries that I added. The homepage resizes the number of images similarly to airbnb, and the spot details page also goes from 5 images to 1.

I was also able to make my forms modular to an extent, to make the css easily transferable between them to cut down on development time so I could focus on adding more features instead
